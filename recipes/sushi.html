            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,

            <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm (1-2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Center a nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. 
                Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
