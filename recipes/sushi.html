            <li>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed (20-25 minutes).</li>
            <li>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</li>

            <li>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm (1-2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Center a nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center.
