        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Mochi (moh-chee) is a popular bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour (mochigome)
             with a soft, chewy, and somewhat elastic texture.<br>Mochi is often flavored with green tea (matcha) powder, 
             giving it a light green hue, but this recipe uses red bean paste (adzuki bean paste/anko) 
             in addition with matcha to provide a unique flavor.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup sweetened red bean paste (adzuki bean paste/anko)</li>
            <li>1 cup glutinous rice flour (mochigome)</li>
            <li>1 tsp green tea powder (matcha)</li>
            <li>1 cup water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cornstarch (to roll out the dough)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Wrap red bean paste in aluminum foil and place in the freezer until solid (&ge;1 hour).</li>
            <li>Mix glutinous rice flour and green tea powder thoroughly in a microwave-safe bowl.</li>

            <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and microwave for 3 minutes and 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>While the rice flour mixture is in the microwave, remove the red bean paste from the freezer and divide it into 8 equal balls. 
                Set these aside for later (step 8).</li>
            <li>Remove the rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat for another 15-30 seconds, covered.</li>
            <li>Dust a work surface with cornstarch.</li> 
            <li>Roll about 2 tablespoons of hot rice flour mixture in a ball, flatten it, and place a ball of frozen red bean paste in the center.<br>

            </li>
            <li>Pinch and press the dough around the bean paste until it is completely covered.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the mochi with additional cornstarch and place seam-side down in a paper muffin liner to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Repeat steps 9-11 to make additional mochi with remaining ingredients, redusting your work surface with cornstarch when necessary.</li>
        </ol>
