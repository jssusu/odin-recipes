            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Mochi (moh-chee) is a popular bun-shaped Japanese dessert made from sweet glutinous rice flour (mochigome)
                with a soft, chewy, and somewhat elastic texture.<br>Mochi is often flavored with green tea (matcha) powder, 
                giving it a light green hue, but this recipe uses red bean paste (adzuki bean paste/anko) 
                in addition with matcha to provide a unique flavor.</p>

                <li>Remove the rice flour mixture from the microwave. Stir and heat for another 15-30 seconds, covered.</li>
                <li>Dust a work surface with cornstarch.</li>
