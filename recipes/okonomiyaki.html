        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Often dubbed as &ldquo;Japanese pizza&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Japanese savory pancake,&rdquo; okonomiyaki is a highly customizable dish that comes in a variety of styles and combines a savory batter with various fillings and toppings&mdash;as the name suggests, it's what you like, grilled. Here is a recipe for an Osaka-style okonomiyaki.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cabbage, finely shredded</li>
            <li>1 cup leeks, well-washed and chopped</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Recommendation</em>: slice them lengthwise, then submerge and wash them in a bowl of water before slicing.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>A few pinches of fine grain sea salt</li>
            <li>2/3 cup whole wheat pastry flour</li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Alternative</em>: 2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                </ul>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1+ tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>Garnish (toasted slivered almonds, chives/any herbs you like)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the cabbage, leeks, flour, and salt in a bowl. Toss until everything is coated with a dusting of flour. Stir in the eggs and mix until everything is evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add a generous splash of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Scoop the cabbage mixture into the pan and press it into a round pancake shape using a metal spatula, as flat as you can get it.</li>
            <li>Cook for 4-5 minutes, or until the bottom is golden.</li>
            <li>Flip the okonomiyaki&mdash;slide it out of the skillet onto a plate, plate another plate on top, and flip both over at the same time.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>If you need more oil in your skillet, add the oil before sliding the okonomiyaki back into the skillet.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Press down on the okonomiyaki with a spatula and cook until golden (&asymp;3-5 minutes).</li>
            <li>Garnish, then cut into wedges.</li>
        </ol>
